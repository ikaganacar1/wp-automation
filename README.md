# wp-automation

This program almost caused to made me crazy but i am fine.

I put my source code as .py file and also all files in .rar file you can download it and run but pls put it a folder like C/:wp_automation 
(i have not enough abilty to do it like setup sorry :D)

This app is for Turkish schools. You put your student lists in it and program reads the students names and their numbers then stores it.
You should enter their phone numbers one by one then you can send messages automaticly when you enter their numbers. It is just for absenteesm messages right now.

I had 4 major problems that i couldn't solve i will try to solve them and update this app later.
-> I couldn't show progress when it is reading from photos.
-> User should not click anywhere (except ones that not affecting the focus) while it is tring to send message.
-> Turkish characters is not available for tkinter i think.
-> It has 60 seconds to send thme message but somtimes it is not enough (when wp.web open first time it downloads so it take time).
